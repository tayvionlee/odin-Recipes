        <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup grapeseed oil, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio</li>
        <li>¼ cup whipping cream</li>

       </ul>
       <h3>Directions</h3>
       <div class="shrimpmeal-steps">
       <ol>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>Meanwhile, butterfly shrimp, and lightly press open.</li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <li>Mix flour, salt, garlic, and black pepper in a shallow dish. Reserve 2 tablespoons flour mixture and set aside. Dredge shrimp in flour mixture until well coated, shaking off excess flour.</li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil and allow to get hot. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the hot oil, add shrimp, and cook until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a pan lined with a drip rack and keep warm.</li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet and stir in reserved flour mixture. Stir and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, but be careful so it doesn't burn. Add chicken broth and white wine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce heat, and add cream and lemon juice. Stir and cook until sauce has slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter until melted.</li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <li>Divide pasta into serving bowls, top with lemon sauce, and 4 to 5 shrimp per serving. Garnish with chopped parsley.</li>
